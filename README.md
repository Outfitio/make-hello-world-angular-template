## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Building for Make

Run `ng build --base-href . --outputPath=dist` to build the project with correct resource pathing for the sake of deploying to make.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `/dist` directory.
